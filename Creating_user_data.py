Intution: Few users were studied to identify their personality types. For the sake of demonstration, 6 personality types have been assumed.
          
          These users were then asked five thoughtful questions (pertaining psychology analysis) and their responses were observed.
          
          This dataset is then used to train an Artificial Neural Network to find a relationship between the personality types and the responses,
          so that the personality types of the new users can be predicted based on their responses to those five questions.
